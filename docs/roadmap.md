# iCRF Generator Roadmap
While we aim to improve the tool, please note that implementation of new features may depend on available funding.

## Planned improvements
- Make the iCRF Generator download the codebooks.txt file instead of letting it be part of the distribution
- Add option to make a ZIP file of the cached codebooks available for download
- Add support for CDISC ODM
- Add support for the Research Manager

## To be investigated further
- Allow users to reuse itemgroups (sets of data-items)
