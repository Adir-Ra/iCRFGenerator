# iCRF Generator Roadmap
While we aim to improve the tool, please note that implementation of new features may depend on available funding.

## Planned improvements
- Add support for CDISC ODM
- Add support for the Research Manager
- Add meta data to the codebooks / links to the ART-DECOR website, to give information about their content
- Improve layout and sizing of windows (based on feedback and demo using multiple codebooks)
- Add option to make a ZIP file of the cached codebooks available for download

## To be investigated further
- Allow users to reuse itemgroups (sets of data-items)
